# React based Chess Timer!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Goal

To create a react based web application that allows users to time moves in a game of chess. Users would be able to place a smartphone next to the chess board and then quickly tap the screen to log their time. If, for example, the 10 minute option is chosen, each user has a total of 10 minutes from which to execute all of their moves. If they run out of their allotted time before a checkmate/stalemate, then that player loses. 

Every touch should switch players instantly. The background should match the corresponding player (i.e. black or white) to make the interface visually aesthetic. A buzzer should go off if a player runs out of time. Maybe having a clicking noise to improve the user experience that mimics the sound of a real chess clock.


## Future Implementations

Ideally this app will allow users to choose from a variety of different time restrictions - thus changing the pace of the game. This will be implemented through a dropdown list offering a few different variations. An additional option of allowing a user to enter a custom time would also be nice!

Another idea is to restrict each player to a certain amount of time for each move (i.e. 10 seconds each to make a move) to encourage faster decision making.
